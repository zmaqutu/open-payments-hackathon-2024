**Overview**

GNPL (Get Now, Pay Later via USSD) is a financial service platform designed for underserved communities where smartphone penetration is low. It allows users to make essential purchases, like medication or groceries, even if they don’t have the funds at the moment. Using a simple USSD interface, users can confirm a loan and set up a repayment schedule, making financial access possible through any basic phone.

The cashier initiates the process via a dashboard where user profiles can be created, and the terms (loan amount, repayment schedule, grace period) are discussed. Once terms are confirmed, the user receives a USSD prompt to accept or decline the offer.

## Key Features

- Dashboard for merchants: Store cashiers can create user profiles and initiate loan applications.

- USSD confirmation: Customers can confirm their loan via a USSD menu, making the process accessible even without a smartphone.

- Custom repayment terms: Users can negotiate grace periods, repayment schedules, and amounts.

- Cloud processing: All loan details and user interactions are processed through cloud functions, ensuring secure and real-time transactions.

- Loan lifecycle management: Full tracking from loan disbursement to repayment.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

- React: Used to build the cashier dashboard where users are registered, and loan terms are set.

- Tailwind CSS: Provides a modern and responsive user interface for the dashboard.

### Backend

- Node.js: Backend server for processing requests.

- Express: Handles API requests between the frontend and the backend.

- Firebase: Hosts the backend cloud functions and database.

### DevOps

- Ngrok: Used for local testing and exposing your local server to the internet for USSD testing.
